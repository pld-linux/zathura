Configuration
zathurarc

The other way is to use a zathurarc file (whose path is defined in the config.h 
file, default: ~/.config/zathura/zathurarc) to change look and key bindings. 
There are two commands that can be used in the rc file:
set [id] [value]
map [key] [function] [argument] [mode]
As an example the rc file could look like this:
# zathurarc
 
# colors
set statusbar_bgcolor #00FF00
set statusbar_fgcolor red
 
# settings
set height 1024
set width 768
set adjust_open width
 
# key bindings
map <PageUp> navigate previous
map <PageDown> navigate next
 
map + zoom in
map - zoom out
 
map <C-q> quit
